          Hi, I'm Samir, and welcome on my profile. I was born and I grew up in Rabat, capital of Morocco. I chose advanced mathematics and physics during my highschool years. I really love maths. I got my moroccan baccalaureate in mathematical specialization with honors. I then decided to study business, and specially finance, because it links my mathematical backgroup to my will to learn about business. I applied and got in the ESSEC Business School, second best businesss school in France, for a Bachelor in Business Administration. I'll put you the link here so you can check their page and the BBA program: <a href="https://www.essec.edu/fr/" rel="ESSEC" target="_blank"> ESSEC</a>.  <br/>

        <h2>Greek Myhtology</h2>
        <p>
        I was always amazed by fantastic movies and superpowers. My neighbor once gave me a book to read from the series "Percy Jackson" when I was like 14 or 15 years old. After finishing the book, I bought all the author's book. Rick Riordan, the author, writes about greek mythology, but also other mythologies. I read then encyclopedias and did researches about greek mythology. My favorite God is Zeus, King of Gods, and my favorite Goddess is Hecate, Goddess of magic.

          <h2>Experiences</h2>

        <p>
          My experiences are mostly in the associative field. I joined Lueur d'Espoir Junior in Rabat, a non-profit association that aims to improve the daily life of families in need, through financial donations, daily meals, and lessons for children. I was responsible of the financing of events for a year, then president for the next year. Now, I am an active member in three associations in ESSEC: Scool&Co, where we give lessons to kids, HeForShe, for gender equality, and ESSEC Maroc, where we share the moroccan culture with other people.
